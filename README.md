# Feature-Engineering-



Feature engineering is a crucial step in the data preprocessing pipeline that involves transforming raw data into meaningful features that better represent the underlying patterns for predictive modeling. In this notebook, we cover various techniques to enhance and select features, which include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and selecting the most informative features using correlation analysis and mutual information. Each technique is illustrated with Python code snippets and outputs to guide the user through the process, emphasizing practical applications in real-world datasets. By the end of this notebook, you will have a solid understanding of how to manipulate and optimize features to improve model performance.

Standardization: This technique scales features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Standardization is especially important for algorithms that assume normally distributed data or for those sensitive to the scale of the data, like SVM and KNN.

Normalization: Alternatively, normalization scales features to a range of [0, 1], which is useful when the data has different units or scales.

Correlation Analysis: Correlation measures the linear relationship between features and the target variable. Features with high correlation to the target or low inter-correlation among themselves are considered important. This method helps in reducing redundancy in the dataset.

Mutual Information: This method evaluates the dependency between features and the target variable. Features with high mutual information values are considered more informative, as they reduce uncertainty about the target when known. This method is particularly useful when the relationships between variables are nonlinear.

Feature Importance from Models: Using models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, we can extract feature importance scores directly from the trained model, indicating which features contribute the most to the modelâ€™s predictions.
